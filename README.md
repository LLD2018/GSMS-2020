GSMS 2020 - An introduction to Bayesian statistics
================
Jorge N. Tendeiro
February xx, 2020

This workshop takes place in room *Maxima* in the *Engels Meeting and
Conference Center* from 9:30 to 14:15 on Febrary, xx, 2020.

I aim at offering a gentle introduction to Bayesian statistics. During
the first half, the most important concepts are introduced. In the
second hour, I will illustrate the richness of Bayesian analyses by
means of real data applications. I will be as visual as possible, so the
idea is to keep the technicalities to a minimum.

All code is freely available from
[Github](https://github.com/jorgetendeiro/GSMS-2020). The slides are
available here:

  - [Slides Part 1](slides/Part1.pdf)
  - [Slides Part 2](slides/Part2.pdf)

All analyses are fully reproducible. I will use both
[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) and [R](https://www.r-project.org) /
[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) as the graphical user interface. The
following R packages will be used and should be installed in case you
want to mimic the analyses shown on the slides:

  - `rstan` : R interface for [Stan](https://mc-stan.org).
  - `bayesplot`: To render plots, fully integrated with Stan.
