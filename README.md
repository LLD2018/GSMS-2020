GSMS 2020 - An introduction to Bayesian statistics
================
Jorge N. Tendeiro
October 29, 2020

This is a 2-hour workshop for the Graduate School of Medical Sciences at the UMCG, Groningen. It takes place online (and perhaps also in-location; tba) from 15:00 on October 29, 2020.

I aim at offering a gentle introduction to Bayesian statistics. During the first half, the most important concepts are introduced. In the second hour, I will illustrate the richness of Bayesian analyses by means of a worked-out empirical application. I will be as visual as possible, so the idea is to keep the technicalities to a minimum.

All code is freely available from
[Github](https://github.com/jorgetendeiro/GSMS-2020). The slides are
available here:

  - [Part 1](slides/Part1.pdf)
  - [Part 2](slides/Part2.pdf)

All analyses are fully reproducible. I used [R](https://www.r-project.org) (with
[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) as the graphical user interface). The
following R packages will be used and should be installed in case you
want to mimic the analyses shown on the slides:

  - `magrittr`
  - `knitr`
  - `psych`
  - `car`
  - `heplots`
  - `emmeans`
  - `rstan`
  - `bayesplot`
  - `gridExtra`
  - `loo`
  - `bridgesampling`
  - `rstanarm`
